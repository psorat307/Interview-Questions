/*
You are given an array of n non-negative integers a1, a2, â€¦, an ,where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). The task is to find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Note: You may not slant the container.

Input Format
First line contains integer n as size of array.
Next line contains N space separated integers that are the elements of the array.

Constraints
n>=2

Output Format
Output maximum water the container contains.

Sample Input
9
1 8 6 2 5 4 8 3 7
Sample Output
49
