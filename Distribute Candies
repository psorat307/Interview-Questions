We can use a set to count all unique kinds of candies, but even all candies are unique, the sister cannot get more than half.

int distributeCandies(vector<int>& candies) {
        unordered_set<int> candytype;
        for(int type : candies) candytype.insert(type);
        return min(candytype.size(),candies.size()/2);
    }
    
 /*
 Alice has n candies, where the ith candy is of type candyType[i]. Alice noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor.
The doctor advised Alice to only eat n / 2 of the candies she has (n is always even). Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to 
eat the maximum number of different types of candies while still following the doctor's advice.
Given the integer array candyType of length n, return the maximum number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats n / 2 of them.

Input: candyType = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 3
